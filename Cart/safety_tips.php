        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify Seller Profiles:</strong> Always check the seller's profile and ratings before making a
                purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Meet in Safe Locations:</strong> Arrange to meet in public places during daylight hours for
                transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If something feels off, trust your gut and consider walking away
                from
                the deal.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Secure Payment Methods:</strong> Avoid cash transactions when possible. Use secure payment
                methods that offer buyer protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious behavior, report it to the
                platform immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Aware:</strong> Be mindful of your surroundings and avoid sharing personal information with
                strangers.</li>
